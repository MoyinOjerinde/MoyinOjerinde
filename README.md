Hi, I’m Moyinoluwa Ojerinde

- I’m currently a Currently a sophomore at Purdue University. Driven by a passion for innovation and problem-solving in computer engineering. I am eager to explore opportunities in hardware, software, and embedded systems to expand my skills and create impactful solutions.

-I've worked on a few class projects such as an Tuner for Blind and Visually Imapaired Students and an Automation System for an afterschool program to automate and visualize survey data and reduce email clutter.

-I've also worked on a few personal projects such as an Accelerometer Data Visualizer that takes accelerometer data from an MPU-6050 accelerometer connected to an ESP32 and streams the velocity and gyroscope graphs in live graphs on Matlab as well as worked on a mini FSM using an Arduino Uno that mimics different vending machine states 

- This semester, I am working towards advancing my skills in C++ and Python while also learning PCB Design, Verilog, and PyTorch.
